# sungka.R

* A simple simulation in R of [sungka](http://tinyurl.com/pzxej77), a traditional game in the Philippines.
* Code and documentation in progress...  ...if I ever get around to it. :D
* Last update: Sungka simulation was driving me crazy, so had to simplify a bit; sungka_variation1.R finally works... ...I think.  Will clean up code and document in coming days.
* Update: The entire Saturday is just gone :D, but at least I managed to simulate the initial round of sungka.  Code is repetitive, so would need massive rewrite to make pretty.  Note to self: learn to write custom functions or procedures. 10/25/2014
* Update: Script drops shells around sungka board for first turn.  10/25/2014
