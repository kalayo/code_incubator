# sungka.R

* A simple simulation in R of [sungka](http://tinyurl.com/pzxej77), a traditional game in the Philippines.
* Code and documentation in progress...  ...if I ever get around to it. :D
* Last update: The entire Saturday is just gone :D, but at least I managed to simulate the initial round of sungka.  Code is repetitive, so would need massive rewrite to make pretty.  Note to self: learn to write custom functions or procedures. 10/25/2014
* Update: Script drops shells around sungka board for first turn.  10/25/2014
